                <p> 1.	Explain the Infrared protocol with transmitter and receiver.

                    The Infrared (IR) protocol is a wireless communication method that uses infrared light to transmit data between a transmitter and a receiver.
                    
                    It is commonly used in remote controls, wireless data transfer, and short-range communication applications.
                    
                    Components
                    
                    Transmitter:
                    Uses an IR LED to emit modulated infrared light.
                    Encodes data into a specific format (e.g., binary) using modulation techniques like pulse-width modulation.
                    
                    Receiver:
                    Utilizes an IR photodiode or phototransistor to detect the incoming IR light.
                    Demodulates the signal to extract the original data and processes it for action.
                    
                    Communication Process:
                    
                    The transmitter encodes and emits a modulated IR signal.
                    The receiver detects the IR light and converts it into an electrical signal.
                    The receiver demodulates the signal to retrieve the original data and executes corresponding actions.
                    
                    Advantages:
                    
                    Low cost and simplicity.
                    Not affected by radio frequency interference.
                    
                    Disadvantages:
                    
                    Requires line of sight and has a limited range (typically a few meters).
                    Can be affected by strong ambient light.
                    
                    Applications:
                    Commonly used in remote controls for TVs and other devices, as well as in short-range data transfer between devices.
                    
                    2.	Explain the Bluetooth interface with Arduino.
                    
                    The Bluetooth interface allows Arduino microcontrollers to communicate wirelessly with other Bluetooth-enabled devices, such as smartphones, tablets, or computers.

          3....List and explain digital I/O functions of        Arduino
          
          Arduino provides several digital I/O functions that allow you to interact with digital pins on the board. These functions enable you to read from and write to digital pins, which can be used for various applications such as controlling LEDs, reading button states, and interfacing 
          
          1)pinMode(pin, mode): 
          Configures a pin as INPUT, OUTPUT, or INPUT_PULLUP.
          Example: pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
          
          2)digitalWrite(pin, value): 
          Sets a pin to HIGH (on) or LOW (off).
          Example: digitalWrite(13, HIGH);
          
          3)analogWrite(pin, value): 
          Writes a PWM signal to a pin (simulates analog output).
          Example: analogWrite(9, 128); (50% duty cycle).
          
          4)digitalRead(pin):
           Reads the state of a pin, returning HIGH or LOW.
          Example: int state = digitalRead(2);

          const int ledPin = 13; // Pin 13 is often used for the built-in LED
          
          // The setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
          void setup() {
            // Initialize the digital pin as an output
            pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
          }
          
          // The loop function runs over and over again forever
          void loop() {
            digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH); // Turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
            delay(1000);                 // Wait for a second (1000 milliseconds)
            digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);  // Turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
            delay(1000);                 // Wait for a second
          }
          
          
          
          
          5....List and explain timer functions of Arduino.
          
          Arduino provides several timer functions that allow you to manage time-based operations in your sketches. These functions are essential for tasks such as creating delays, measuring time intervals, and scheduling events without blocking the main program flow.
          
          
          1)delay(ms): Pauses the program for a specified number of milliseconds. (Blocking)
          
          2)delayMicroseconds(us): Pauses the program for a specified number of microseconds. (Blocking)
          
          3)millis(): Returns the number of milliseconds since the program started. Useful for non-blocking timin</p>
