Chapter – 5
Explain how to implement “Arduino based internet communication.
Ans: Arduino-Based Internet Communication: Quick Notes

1. Hardware Requirements:

Arduino Board: (e.g., Arduino Uno, Mega, or Nano)
Communication Module:
Ethernet Shield: For wired connections.
WiFi Module (ESP8266/ESP32): For wireless connections.
GSM Module: For cellular communication.

2. Software Requirements:

Arduino IDE: Install the latest version.
Libraries: Include necessary libraries:
Ethernet.h for Ethernet.
ESP8266WiFi.h or WiFi.h for ESP32.
GSM.h for GSM modules.

3. Setup Steps:

Connect Hardware: Attach the communication module to the Arduino.
Configure Network: Set up static IP (optional) or WiFi credentials.

4. Testing:

Access the Arduino's IP address in a web browser to see the response.

6. Data Communication:

Use HTTP requests (GET/POST) to send and receive data.

7. Advanced Options:

Consider using MQTT for IoT applications or WebSocket for real-time communication.

8. Security:

Implement HTTPS and authentication for secure data transmission.

Draw and explain the interfacing of a pressure sensor with Arduino. Also write a program for the same.
